# accessibility-guide

This is a currently a jekyll app, please following these instructions to install jekyll.

<a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/">Jekyll Step by Step Tutorial</a>

To build locally: bundle exec jekyll build

To build and serve locally: bundle exec jekyll serve

New accessibility guide content is added in the guidelines folder using a numbering system for ordering, this gets around jekyll's need for a date when using 'posts'.

Please add a permalink to the correct title removing the number from the start.

The app is deployed using halfpipe to

dev: http://accessibility-guidelines.dev.private.springernature.io/
live: http://accessibility-guidelines.live.public.springernature.io/
